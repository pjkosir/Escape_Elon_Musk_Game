                                      TESLA                                     
 The Story:                                                                    
   You find your way to SpaceX the night before the Roadster is mounted atop the 
   rocket which is to send it into space.  The building is dark and the roadster 
   is hidden somewhere in large open dark room (15x15).  In addition to the    
   roadster, two other cars (a Yugo and ford pinto) are being stored in this    
   facility as well.      
   
   BTW: Elon Musk is sleeping somewhere in the same room and you have to avoid  
   waking him to find your way to the roadster. Once awoken he will randomly 
   move through the building looking for you. If he lands next to you, you can 
   get away from him only once. The second time you will be the Starman and 
   blasted into space with his roadster. Once he is awake your only chance to 
   avoid being Starman is to make your escape in his roadster. If you get into
   either of the other two cars you will be caught and become the Starman. 
   
 How to Play:
   The goal for the user is to find the roadster before becoming the Star man.
